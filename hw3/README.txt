Please use "inp.txt" as input file and output/write the results of each questions to a separate file named as "q1a.txt", "q1b.txt" etc. The output files should have the same format as the input file "inp.txt". The CUDA programs don't take in any command line arguments. All subparts in a question should be implmented in a single program. e.g. 'q1 a' and 'q1 b' should be implemented in q1.cu.

You only need to submit two source code files, q1.cu, q2.cu along with the input file "inp.txt". Don't submit any other files.

Submission structure:
